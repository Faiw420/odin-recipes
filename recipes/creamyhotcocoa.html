    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's old fashioned, it's comforting, it makes the kitchen smell wonderful and it's good for the soul.</p>
    <p>Tested by me, really delicious.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>nonstick cooking spray</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs  </li>
            <li>and more...</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Combine Parmesan cheese, panko, and garlic powder in a shallow bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Brush skin liberally with mayonnaise. Press each thigh, skin-side down, into crumb mixture. Place thighs on baking sheet, skin-side up, and mist lightly with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 35 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
